For enthusiastsü§î: Well, I guess I solved an array problem while creating this bot. You'll notice a good application of the solution of this problem in my code.
### Problem: How do you merge two arrays with some no. (x) of same elements at the end of first array and at the beginning of second array so that they both encounter those elements only once.
for e.g. merging [1,2,4,5,2,3,5,6,7] & [5,6,7,3,5,4,2,7,3] should give [1,2,4,5,2,3,5,6,7,3,5,4,2,7,3]. Notice 5,6,7 are in both array, lies in end of first array and beginning of second one. It could be possible that more of their occurences exist.
